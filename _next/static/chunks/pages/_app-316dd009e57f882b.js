In response, the concept of &quot;Green IT&quot; has emerged, emphasizing the need for eco-friendly software development and operational practices. By highlighting key architectural patterns, development practices, and operational strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of IT applications, it challenges software vendors and developers to explore how they can contribute to greater sustainability.</p>\\n<h3>Sustainable Software Development Practices</h3>\\n<p>Well-architected software plays a pivotal role in reducing the environmental impact of digital systems. Sustainability in software development involves the consideration of various factors throughout the entire lifecycle:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Agile and Modular Development</strong>: Develop software iteratively, focusing on essential functionality and creating modular, reusable components.</li>\\n<li><strong>Programming Language Choice</strong>: Opt for compiled languages such as <a href=\\"/special-spork/languages-and-frameworks/rust/\\">Rust</a> or <a href=\\"/special-spork/languages-and-frameworks/go-lang/\\">Go</a> that have lower energy consumption during execution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation and Infrastructure-as-Code</strong>: Automate resource management and shut down unused infrastructure during idle periods to decrease energy consumption.</li>\\n<li><strong>Demand Shaping</strong>: Schedule energy-intensive workloads to align with the availability of renewable energy sources.</li>\\n<li><strong>Green Power</strong>: Source electricity from sustainable and renewable sources.</li>\\n<li><strong>Optimized Hardware and Software Lifespan</strong>: Extend the life of hardware and software through thoughtful design and maintenance.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Metrics and Measurement</h3>\\n<p>Software applications, especially those hosted in data centers, have a substantial environmental footprint as they require significant amounts of energy to operate. In addition, their development and use often necessitate the production of hardware devices such as servers, laptops, and smartphones.</p>\\n<p>Assessing the carbon emissions throughout an application&#39;s lifecycle enables developers and enterprises to make informed decisions that reduce emissions, lower costs, and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Measuring energy consumption highlights areas where software can be optimized for improved efficiency. Environmental metrics support sustainability reporting, showcasing an organization&#39;s commitment to eco-friendly practices.</p>\\n<h3>Beware the Rebound Effect</h3>\\n<p>Efficiency improvements often lead to time and cost savings, which can paradoxically lead to more workload and less energy savings - a rebound effect. Finding a balance between efficiency gains and sustainable growth is critical to sustainable software development.</p>\\n<h3>Digitalization&#39;s Environmental Impact</h3>\\n<p>The environmental impact of digitalization is a nuanced interplay between its potential for energy consumption and its ability to promote sustainability.</p>\\n<p>Blockchain technology utilizing energy-intensive mining processes of proof-of-work consensus mechanisms demands immense computational power, resulting in substantial carbon emissions. Machine learning, a cornerstone of AI, requires vast amounts of data and computational resources.</p>\\n<p>However, digitalization also emerges as a champion of environmental stewardship in several areas: Demand-driven production optimizes inventory, reduces waste, and curtails unnecessary production, ultimately minimizing energy consumption and emissions. The digital product passport introduces traceability and transparency throughout a product&#39;s lifecycle, promoting sustainability and empowering consumers to make eco-conscious choices.</p>\\n<h3>A Greener Future for IT</h3>\\n<p>Sustainable software development is not only an ethical imperative but also a competitive advantage. However, achieving comprehensive sustainability is a complex task. More than just minimizing energy consumption, Green IT compels us to make conscientious choices at every stage of the software development lifecycle. By adopting architectural patterns that prioritize sustainability, optimizing code, and embracing best practices in operations, we can contribute to a more eco-friendly digital future.</p>\\n","featured":true,"flag":"default","tags":["architecture","coding"],"position":[550,129]},{"id":"harbor","release":"2024-07-10","title":"Harbor","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"platforms-and-aoe-services","body":"<p><a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://goharbor.io\\">Harbor</a> has become the de-facto standard for self-hosted container registries in our projects.</p>\\n","featured":true,"flag":"changed","tags":["devops"],"revisions":[{"release":"2023-11-01","ring":"trial","body":"<p>We continue to utilize <a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://goharbor.io\\">Harbor</a> in our projects.

It balances the simplicity of monolithic systems with the flexibility of microservices by ensuring that the monolith is well-structured into discrete, encapsulated modules.</p>\\n<p>The concept of the strategic monolith stems from the idea that starting with a monolithic architecture can be beneficial for many organizations, especially when dealing with new or smaller projects. Monoliths are easier to develop, test, and deploy because of their cohesive nature. As Martin Fowler points out, many successful software systems have started as monoliths and only transitioned to microservices when scale or complexity required it. This approach allows teams to manage complexity and maintainability while providing a foundation for potential future transitions to microservices. By modularizing the monolith, developers create clear boundaries within the codebase, making it easier to extract individual services as needed.</p>\\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Future-Proof Architecture</strong>: Modular design within a monolith allows for parts of the system to be easily extracted into individual microservices as requirements evolve or the business grows. This approach ensures that the architecture can adapt to changing needs without extensive refactoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Operational Simplicity</strong>: Starting with a monolithic architecture simplifies deployment and management by keeping all modules within a single deployable unit. This reduces the complexity and overhead associated with distributed systems, such as handling inter-service communication, distributed data management, and comprehensive monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Performance and Latency Benefits</strong>: Intra-process communication within a monolith results in lower latency and higher performance compared to inter-service communication in microservices. This ensures that the system remains responsive and efficient as it scales.</li>\\n<li><strong>Reduced Complexity</strong>: A &quot;monolith first&quot; approach avoids the initial challenges of distributed systems, allowing teams to focus on building robust features and gaining a deep understanding of the domain before considering a transition to microservices.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At AOE, we strive to follow this approach when starting greenfield projects. We aim to balance between creating systems that are &quot;as small as possible&quot; yet &quot;as big as necessary,&quot; ensuring robust and maintainable architectures that can scale and evolve with business needs. This provides a balanced path that aligns immediate development needs with long-term architectural goals.</p>\\n","featured":true,"flag":"new","tags":["architecture"],"position":[604,259]},{"id":"monorepo","release":"2023-11-01","title":"Monorepo","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","body":"<p>Adopting a monorepo approach for our React and Next.js-based projects offers several benefits, <em>although it may not be\\nthe best fit for every project.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>More efficient code sharing and reusability.</li>\\n<li>Consistent development environment.</li>\\n<li>Easier cross-project refactoring.</li>\\n<li>Improved collaboration.</li>\\n<li><strong>Simplified Dependency Management</strong>: In our monorepo, we can manage dependencies at the repository level, simplifying\\nthe process of keeping everything up to date and avoiding version conflicts.</li>\\n<li><strong>Streamlined CI/CD Pipeline</strong>: A single CI/CD pipeline that can build and test all our projects simultaneously.\\nThis, of course, comes with the drawback of a more complicated CI/CD setup and potentially longer running pipelines.</li>\\n<li><strong>Better Code Ownership</strong>: It&#39;s easier to determine who is responsible for each part of the codebase, which can\\nimprove code ownership and accountability.</li>\\n<li><strong>Simplified Testing</strong>: We can set up end-to-end tests and integration tests that cover the entire application more\\neasily in a monorepo, ensuring that changes in one part of the codebase don&#39;t break other parts.</li>\\n<li><strong>Codebase Navigation</strong>: Developers can easily navigate through different parts of the codebase without having to\\nswitch between multiple repositories or projects.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>However, it is important to note that monorepos are not a one-size-fits-all solution.</strong> They can introduce complexity,\\nespecially in very large projects, and may not be suitable for all team sizes or development workflows.

RSCs represent a new application architecture paradigm within React designed to reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. The ultimate goal is to enhance performance, user experience, and maintainability.</p>\\n<p>This new feature enables the creation of components that exclusively run on the server. As a result, there is no impact on the bundle size downloaded by the client. For instance, libraries used in server components are not shipped to the client. RSCs also have the capability to access server-side resources, such as databases and the file system, directly.</p>\\n<p>In addition to server components, there are client components, which are essentially the classic components everyone is familiar with. The only distinction is that client components need to be explicitly declared using a directive. Determining which components should be client or server can be one of the more challenging aspects, especially when the goal is to migrate existing applications.</p>\\n<p>RSCs appear to be most effective when used with Server Side Rendering, although it is possible to use them without it. RSCs and Server Side Rendering complement each other well, as server components are only rendered once on the server and do not need to be sent to the client. Client components are still rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client side. However, with a well-structured application that minimizes client-side code and in combination with React 18&#39;s <a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37\\">Suspense and Selective Hydration</a> features, a performance boost is expected. To test this hypothesis, the React team has collaborated with Vercel, the maintainer of <a href=\\"/special-spork/languages-and-frameworks/next-js/\\">NextJS</a>, to integrate RSCs into a suitable environment early.</p>\\n<p>Overall, we recognize the potential of this new approach, even though there are several steps to take, particularly for meta-frameworks to achieve production readiness. It appears to be only a matter of time before adoption of React Server Components becomes widespread. This is why we have placed it in the assess ring, keeping a watchful eye on this evolving technology.</p>\\n","featured":true,"flag":"default","tags":["frontend","coding"],"position":[599,154]},{"id":"react","release":"2023-11-01","title":"React.js","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"languages-and-frameworks","body":"<p>React today is the most widely used frontend library within our company, employed in various forms. Whether it&#39;s integrated into frameworks like <a href=\\"/special-spork/languages-and-frameworks/next-js/\\">NextJS</a> and <a href=\\"/special-spork/languages-and-frameworks/remix/\\">Remix</a> or utilized for client-side-only applications, React plays a significant role in many of our ongoing projects. Over time, a community of experts has emerged within the company.</p>\\n<p>We firmly believe that React 18, with its range of new features, will further enhance its popularity within our company and the broader community.</p>\\n<h3>Suspense</h3>\\n<p>While not an entirely new feature, Suspense was initially introduced in a basic version back in 2018. However, it had certain limitations. Its first official use case was code splitting with <code>React.lazy</code>, but this feature was only available on the client side, not during server rendering. The primary goal has always been to enhance the loading experience both on the client and server. With React 18, Suspense now enables Streaming server rendering, a new feature that allows React to send the HTML of the loading fallback first and then, after loading completes, send the actual HTML content to the client. The React team continues to work on improving Suspense, particularly to enable data fetching libraries to use it. They are collaborating with authors of some of the most prominent libraries like TanStack Query, SWR, and Apollo.</p>\\n<h3>Server Components</h3>\\n<p>Server Components represent a new paradigm in React application architecture with the goal of minimizing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. This approach introduces a new type of component that operates exclusively on the server. It shows great promise, which is why we have given <a href=\\"/special-spork/methods-and-patterns/react-server-components/\\">React Server Components</a> a dedicated entry on our Tech Radar.</p>\\n<h3>Concurrency</h3>\\n<p>This is a fundamental update to React&#39;s rendering model, primarily occurring under the hood. It introduces the ability to create multiple versions of a user interface concurrently. With concurrent React, rendering can be interrupted, abandoned, and resumed, allowing the application to respond to user interactions immediately, even if it&#39;s currently in the middle of rendering.</p>\\n<p>The React team is collaborating closely with some of the major players in the React ecosystem to stabilize and enhance the library.

RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models, enabling AI to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses by accessing and integrating external data sources during the generation process. This approach often uses embeddings to convert text into high-dimensional vectors and vector databases to efficiently store and retrieve these vectors based on similarity searches.

Attack vectors range from external dependencies in source code to operating systems and tools used in build, test, and production environments. Compromise of a single stage of the supply chain may lead to compromise of the produced software and subsequently of customers that rely on it.</p>\\n<p>Over the last few years, successful attacks on large software vendors have demonstrated the potential impact of such attacks. For instance, the SolarWinds Orion software was <a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarWinds#2019%E2%80%932020_supply_chain_attacks\\">compromised</a> due to an insecure password that allowed attackers to inject a backdoor into software artifacts. Several SolarWinds customers, including US federal government agencies, were compromised as a result of this attack. The <a target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/\\">xz backdoor</a> showed that malicious parties are also stepping up their efforts to place backdoors in widely used open-source software projects in ways that are very hard to detect and prevent.</p>\\n<p>Software libraries and other external dependencies are a major attack vector when building software. We use the following measures regarding external dependencies to improve supply chain security:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Verify dependency artifact signatures and checksums to detect artifacts that were released or replaced by an attacker.</li>\\n<li>Raise developer awareness regarding malicious dependencies and issues such as typosquatting in dependency package managers.</li>\\n<li>Generate <a href=\\"/special-spork/platforms-and-aoe-services/sbom/\\">Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)</a> for transparency regarding used software dependencies and to support the automated detection of known vulnerabilities.</li>\\n<li>Evaluate and reduce the number of external dependencies to minimize the attack surface.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We believe that supply chain security can only be achieved when taking every step of the supply chain into account. Therefore, we utilize the DevSecOps lifecycle and evaluate potential attack vectors and countermeasures for the complete software development and operation lifecycle.

This is where visual regression tests come into play, solving a critical problem faced by developers: detecting unintended visual changes.

In this respect, they exceed and replace some use cases of traditional unit tests, which focus on functional aspects of the code.</p>\\n<p>Visual regression tests address several challenges. They ensure consistency in the user interface, a crucial aspect of user experience.
